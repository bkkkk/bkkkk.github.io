<p>Hey digital flyers, my name is Jacob Blanco. I'm a PhD student in particle physics  at RHUL in the UK. If you care I'm working as part of the Top group for the ATLAS collaboration at CERN. If you're a parent, check out <a href="https://project-cernland.web.cern.ch/project-CERNland/">CERN for kids</a>; it's a nice resource for children to learn about the amazing work being done at CERN.</p>
<p>I decided to make this blog because my brain explodes every day with things I want to talk (rant) about and share with people. I think we live in a wonderful world  and sharing our experiences and knowledge with others  is a fantastic way of exploring it. If you want to follow me online use the following links or you just leave a comment on the  blog. I hope you enjoy reading The Jay Space.</p>

_This is part I of the GTD Concepts series, looking at GTD Concepts patterns that you can apply almost anywhere to help you reduce friction. Please enjoy, leave a comment below, and thank you for reading._

I've been practicing David Allen's getting things done (GTD) philosophy, having achieved a good level of awareness and control over the stuff in my life. Over time some interesting patterns have emerged, which can be adapted and used in other situations. Let's have a quick look through them and how you can adopt them too.

Today we'll go through the entry point into your trusted system, the inbox.

## The inbox

The first concept you learn about in GTD is the idea of an inbox. It acts as the catch-all location for everything in your life. At some later time, usually during a daily or weekly review, you look at the inbox and in order go through and deal with everything in there. You throw away some unwanted receipts, add a task to your todo list to plan a trip to the spa for which you got a brochure, and file away some bills.

### Actions and tasks

For action-tracking I use OmniFocus in-built inbox, from there I can easily organize my tasks or do smaller tasks immediately and marked them as done.

### Home paperwork

At home I have a three-tier inbox where I drop bills, letters, post-its, brochures, and other paper materials I've collected through-out the day.

### Text on the go

Capturing on the go happens in Drafts on iOS. Textual snippets like tweets, messages, shopping lists, and present ideas go into the Drafts inbox. Later I will go through them and dispatch them to the appropriate place like running lists on Dropbox or Twitter.

### Text at the desk

I use [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) to capture notes on my MacBook. This acts as my inbox for medium to long textual information. Meeting minutes, research notes, course notes, code snippets, and small tutorials. Even this blog post started out in nvALT. I am still experimenting with this application in an attempt to replace Evernote.

### Running lists

Lately I've started using running lists to keep track of songs, books, movies, games, and TV shows I get exposed to when I'm out. You can even have a running list of gift ideas. Particularly useful now that the holidays and my anniversary are coming up.

### Used clothes

My girlfriend has a large pile of clothes in our room, clothes that she's worn but aren't to go into the laundry basket. This always irked because there is just a random pile of clothes. After some thought I realized this was her clothes inbox pile. Maybe she doesn't have time to put stuff up or put it into the laundry basket, so it just goes in a pile. Brilliant!

Joe Buhlig ([@JoeBuhlig](http://www.twitter.com/joebuhlig)) has written a [nice little article](http://joebuhlig.com/inbox/) on our natural tendency to create inboxes for almost anything.

## What's the benefit?

**Capture it all**

There is one place and you can just throw almost everything into it. There is no need to think or plan, just type, save and forget. Without the mental burden of organization you can quickly capture a huge number of items without a second thought. You never miss anything and spend very little energy on it.

**Let's it perculate**

In some cases some ideas or content might look interesting at first but later turn out to be useless. Like a site that might have relevant information now, but because of a change in plans the content is no longer relevant. Having an inbox allows for these items to be recorded and then later easily discarded without the wasted overhead of organizing it.

## The take-home

Inboxes can be a very powerful tool in your productivity arsenal. They allow you to capture and collect everything that might be of interest in a singular location reducing the amount of places you need to go looking for things.

Go ahead and try to identify a few of your inboxes and a few places you could use an inbox. **Post your results in the comment section!**

In part II we will look at the idea of breaking things down and tackling the individual pieces, helping you focus and getting more done by avoiding inefficient multitasking.

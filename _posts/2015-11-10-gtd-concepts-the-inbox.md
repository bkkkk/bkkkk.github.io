_This is part I of a series looking at interesting GTD concepts that have applications elsewhere and can make your life a little bit more friction free. Next part is about the idea of segmentation of actions. Please enjoy, leave a comment below, and thank you for reading._

I've been practicing David Allen's GTD, having achieved a good level of awareness and control of most of the stuff in my life. I will likely write another post later as a look-back at my first year with GTD.

I've noticed some interesting patterns emerging from my use of the methodology. Some of these can be adapted and used in other situations. Let's have a quick look through them and how you can adopt them too.

Today we'll go through the entry point into your trusted system, the inbox.

## The inbox

One of the earliest concepts you learn in GTD is the idea of an inbox. The inbox acts as the catch-all location for everything in your life. At some later time you look at your inbox and serious deal with everything in there. Maybe you throw away some unwanted receipts or plan a trip to the spa for which you got a brochure.

For action-tracking I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) which provides you with an inbox. At home I have an inbox where bills, letters, post-its, brochures, and other materials get dropped into.

Capturing on the go happens in [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) on iOS. Textual snippets like tweets, messages, shopping lists, present ideas, and others go into the Drafts inbox and are sent to the appropriate place like running lists on Dropbox or Twitter.

When I'm on my Mac I use [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) as my inbox for medium to long textual information. Notes from work, course notes, code snippets, small tutorials. Even this blog post is actually being written in nvALT.

Lately I've started using running lists to keep track of songs, books, movies, games, and TV shows I get exposed to when I'm out. You can even have a running list of gift ideas. Particularly useful now that the holidays and my anniversary are coming up.

Joe Buhlig has written a [great article](http://joebuhlig.com/inbox/) on our natural tendency to create inboxes almost everywhere we are our and with everything we use.

## What's the benefit?

The great thing about inboxes is that they allow you to record content quickly and easily without the additional burden of having to find the appropriate place for the idea when you have it. You might see an advert for a movie while walking down the street. It's not the most convenient time to load Evernote and add the title to your watch list, but you also don't want to forget. Open your running list, add "Star Wars" to the list and move on with your life.

In some cases some ideas or content might look interesting at first but later turn out to be useless. Like a site that might have relevant information now, but because of a change in plans, the content is no longer relevant. Having an inbox allows for these items to be recorded and then later easily discarded without the wasted overhead of organizing it.

In part II we will look at the idea of breaking things down and tackling the individual pieces, helping you focus and getting more done by avoiding inefficient multitasking.

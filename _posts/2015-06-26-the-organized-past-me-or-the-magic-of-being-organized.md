Confession, I am terrible at being aware of what I need to have with me at any given point. I know I need to go to the meeting, but I have no idea where it is. I know I need to sign up for internet connection, but I don't have the proof of address that you need.

This is one of those areas where GTD has had almost magical results. Because I now plan everything ahead, creating a list of all steps required to complete a certain project, I always have the things I need with me, without even having to think about it.

Going back to the internet connection, I may not be going to the store for a few days, but since I've planned everything ahead I've created the following action list:

Get internet connection:
- Go online and find out how much it will cost
- Find out where the store is
- Find out which paperwork you need
- Put paperwork in bag
- Go to the store and sign up.


Now it could be that one Thursday I put the paperwork in my bag and completely forget about it. Come Monday I make my way to the store because that's what the todo list says. But shit the paperwork I forgot! Oh wait it's in my bag! My past self is so smart and organized, thanks buddy!

Instead of feeling shit for forgetting the paperwork, I get this strange sense that somebody is secretly organizing my life. The truth is there is no secret assistant, it's just me. I now feel a lot more safe and secure in the knowledge that the very next action I am taking is the right one to take.

Someday I will write a bit more about my experiences with GTD and my current job, but today is not that day.

Until I see you next time, have a great day!

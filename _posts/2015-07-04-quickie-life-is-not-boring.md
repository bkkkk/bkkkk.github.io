I've been reading about insight meditation lately, and in his book 'Mindfulness In Plain English'--which I read on the toilet at work-- Henepola Gunaratana mentions how we all naturally label our experiences as either good, bad, or neutral. We try to have more of the good experiences, we try to reduce or avoid bad experiences, and we simply ignore the neutral experiences.

A hell of a lot gets said about reframing bad experiences as good. Something can be also said about taking good experiences with a pinch of salt because 'this too shall pass', but what people rarely appreciate, is just amazing those seemingly neutral moments are.

It might be my training as a scientist, but consider the confluence of events that need to happen every moment for what you call your now to actually happen. The fact that you're reading this means that somewhere out there hundreds of people worked together with incredibly complex machines to produce electricity, the table that you're working on probably contains several materials that have been sourced, processed, and shipped from many places around the world through the combined effort of hundreds of people, and the fact that you can even read thing implies your eyeballs have been able to perceive as many as 7,000,000 colours which are processed by a fraction of the 100 billion neurons that make up your brain, interpreting the shapes that we call letters as collectively having a meaning based on a social agreement that was influenced by 1000s of years of human civilization.

So next time you're bored out of your mind, just look at your colourful carpet and realize that you're on a tiny rock that is spinning around a giant ball of thermonuclear exploding gas and appreciate the shit out of that carpet.

That wasn't really a quickie was it?

I'm using ```Editorial``` on iPad with a handful of workflows! I can even upload photos straight from my iPad and include them in the posts.

If you're interested, take a look Robert Vojta's [description](http://www.robertvojta.com/2015/05/12/editorial-workflows-for-jekyll-blogging/) of his Editorial workflows, and download them straight to your iPad/iPhone.

An alternative is [prose.io](http://prose.io), but requires you giving permission to a third-party site which you might not be comfortable with.

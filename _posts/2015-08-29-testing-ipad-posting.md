I'm using [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) from *omz-software* on the iPad with a handful of workflows to post directly to github pages! I can even upload photos straight from iPad and include them in the posts without ever touching my laptop.

If you're interested, take a look Robert Vojta's [description](http://www.robertvojta.com/2015/05/12/editorial-workflows-for-jekyll-blogging/) of his Editorial workflows and download them to your iPad/iPhone.

An alternative is [prose.io](http://prose.io), but it requires you giving permission to a third-party site; you might not be comfortable with that.

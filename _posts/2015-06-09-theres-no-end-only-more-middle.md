So yesterday was a disaster of my own making. In the past I would have probably blamed it, partly, on somebody else. It's actually much better to think about what was under my control and how to improve. In her instructive book "13 Things mentally strong people don't do", Amy Morin describes the bad habit of blaming external influences for bad things that happen to you. In short, blaming others means you're giving away control of your life to somebody else, while at the same time putting yourself in the comfortable, yet ultimately self defeating, position of being a passive victim. This means you are much less likely to examine your own actions and try to improve. I mean why should I fix my behaviour if it was somebody else's fault? As with many of these pernicious habits, it is self-perpetuating. By not examining your own actions it's likely you will commit mistakes again that lead you to getting further into "the hole".

It is important to realize that your frustration and exhaustion are temporary but important markers of issues to work on. In this case, taking too much work on without realizing. Taking too much on and not managing expectations in a calm and honest way, is discussed extensively in Richard Martin's excellent book "The Clean Coder". The text is clearly written with programmers in mind, but a lot of the scenarios and advice he discusses are applicable to any field where the requirements of your work change from one moment to the next.

In my case, I should have been to realize that a new requirement had been introduced. This should have lead to a five minute thinking session followed by the conclusion that it was going to take more time than I had.

Bus has arrived, I hope you have a great day bye!!!

I start a blog every 3 years. Usually because I read an article or listened to a podcast and I'm dying to talk about to anybody that will listen. Usually though there is nobody around so I take to writing.

The paper doesn't freaking reply though! I the ask myself, if nobody is talking back, if there is no conversation, what the hell is point? And there I stop.

Time for a change of motivation. From now I write to improve my writing skills. To that end I decided to firewall every other morning commute to dedicate myself to writing.

These 30-minute window of completely free time has been great. It's like a little me time that I get to fill with whatever I feel like doing that day. Do you wanna read the Dresden File #1? Bus Ride! Do you wanna start writing? Bus Ride!

This delimited time means not only that I get to do something, but it also means I have to finish it. I can't have things half-done (or half-started, whatever your philosophical disposition might be). As far as the blog posts go, whatever is written by the time the bus comes to a halt at my stop, is what goes online.

I've been listening to Back to Work, a podcast with Merlin Mann where they talk about life, productivity and achieving your goals. Every morning I have it in the background while I make breakfast. It's a refreshingly sincere podcast about. I suggest you listen from the start. The discussion can meander but in general it's a very insightful and honest look at simply being human.

Holy crap it's boiling in this bus! Melting!

I started using OmniFocus, been playing around trying to implement a trusted system to organize myself. It's strange how scary it is to have implicit trust in your organizational system. The truth is that having everything in your head is a terrible solution. You will forgot things, you will miss appointments and won't get stuff done, and yet it's strangely scary to hand over control over your stuff to a piece of software, or a piece of paper, or a text file. A strong theme in my life lately has been self-examination and improvement. So I will continue to work on how I get organized, that is without succumbing to organizational porn.

Yes, that was all over the place and I make no apologies for it. Oh and there is my stop. Bye bye, see you next ride.

P.S. OK, I lied at a coffee shop right now, couldn't abide by the typos.

title: About me
---

My name is Jacobo Blanco, and I am a data scientist and programmer. My research interests vary and I will work on any topic as long as I can sink my teeth into it and learn a lot.

I was born in Argentina but I lived in many different countries like Israel, Spain, the UK and Ireland. I'm a PhD in particle physics, having worked with the ATLAS collaboration at CERN in the area of Top quark physics research.

During my PhD I worked heavily with C++ and Bash so those are my two strongest languages but I've recently started using R and I am quickly developing my understanding of the framework. I've been having a lot of fun recently building web apps using Shiny.

If you want to get in touch, leave a comment on the relevant post or just drop me an e-mail [here](mailto:jayb88@gmail.com), and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.

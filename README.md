Hey intrepid explorer! My site is based entirely on the talented Dean Attali's Beautiful Jekyll theme. This is from his official repo for the template

> "**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly.  [Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes or look at [my personal website](http://deanattali.com) to see it in use.

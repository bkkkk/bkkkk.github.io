*This part 1 of a two part article on the events that led me to take up GTD. It's a little depressing but it has a good ending so don't be sad*

Most of my articles are based on practical information that I want to share or some random thoughts that I want to get out of my head. This is different.

This is the story of how I screwed up everything and then brought myself back.

I started a degree in Physics in 2006 in the UK. through-out I did pretty well but I often felt overwhelmed and procrastinated a lot. I missed some classes and failed to hand in some work. Nevertheless I'd made it from one year to the next, with each jump in difficulty and volume of work I noticed myself avoiding work more. My final year was a disaster. The typical week had 25+ hours of lectures, and I was travelling over 2 hours every day to lectures in London. On top we had the master thesis and a research review to write over the year. Since most of the lectures were elective I was by myself for most of them. Without my classmates for support I avoided attending lectures, missed deadlines, missed material, and felt increasingly isolated. I was constantly flustered and ashamed. I made excuses and lied to avoid being embarrased.

I'd signed up for very difficult classes that covered material which was way beyond my capabilities. I should have changed my registration. I did nothing about it. After attending one class I realized I wasn't going to catch up to the material. I gave up. I didn't attend a single class after that. In the final exam I fumbled through the first question, wrote an apology note to the examiner, and collapsed on my little exam desk.

Until my penultimate year I was on track for a *first*[^first-class]. After working incredibly hard before exams, I managed to only dropped one classification to a 2:1. An absolute miracle. Had I left that impossible course and applied myself more through-out the year I would've done much better. I would have done myself proud. My first degree was rife with stress, many sleepless nights trying to catch up to material or finish important piece of course work on time. I felt useless and broken, I'd let myself and other people down. I was completely exhausted. So naturally I decided to do a PhD.

After my masters I got the chance to work at CERN during my final year. It was an amazing opportunity that encouraged me to continue my career as a physicist. I'd chulked up all my failures during the degree to the stress and exhaustion that naturally comes with doing a very tough degree subject. After an incredible experience at CERN, meeting amazing people, in a beautiful country, working on cutting-edge science with talented and hardworking people from all over the planet (does it sound like I'm bragging?) I was re-energized and ready to take on the world.

Except I wasn't. Not even a little bit.

PhDs are incredibly hard they will test everything you have. The pattern repeated only this time, I had no excuses, nowhere to hide from criticism. I was working directly with supervisors and colleagues. Other people's very real work depended on me. If I didn't do something, it meant others had to pick up the slack. If I failed to meet a deadline, I'd better have a damn reason. I was completely disorganized and overwhelmed yet again. I was told that I might not graduate if things continued this way. I had no idea how to fix the situation. I had no idea what the problem even was. I felt guilty for not feeling guilty enough for not doing the work. I felt ashamed that I wasn't good enough to complete work like my other colleagues did. Why didn't I know as much as my team mates? Why are they able to complete work and I wasn't? Was I not working long enough hours? I stopped showing up to work, avoided flying out to conferences and made interminable excuses for why I wasn't making progress.

It started to affect other aspects of my life, I procrastinated on paying for bills because I was terrified of not having enough money. Which mean that I ended up paying late fees on a couple of bills. The irony is strong with this one.

I remember sitting in my girlfriends car, with the phone in my hand and tears in my eyes. I'd just gotten an email from my supervisor. It was one of many in a series of scathing reviews of my performance and capabilities as a PhD student. They were short and brutal, they cut right to the bone. And they were all absolutely justified.

What the hell was wrong with me? Why, no matter how bad I felt, couldn't I muster the will to do something about it all. I felt like quiting so many times. Just ask my girlfriend.

I now understand at least part of the problem. I'd attempted, for some reason, to manage my entire adult life using my head. From primary school to high school to university, the increase in the number of things tugging at my attention gradually increased. Now I notice this pattern of perpetual stress in my parents, again trying to amanage everything in their brain.

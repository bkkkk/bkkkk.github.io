This is particularly important with actions and projects. We all have projects which we are not going to get to. Like learning that new language or cleaning the attic. Ask yourself who are you helping by keeping that dead project on your todo list? If you truly want to do those things but you simply have no time, then are you really using your time correctly?

If it's a project that you think you want, but not enough to push other things just get rid of from your todo list. If it helps you dump it in a separate list. This is how I use my Someday/Maybe list. A place where my hopes, dreams, and whims go. Some of them get upgraded to full-blown tasks that I complete, others just wither away and disappear. The important part is to be honest and ruthless.

This approach can be taken with anything you might be gathering up, email, your childhood effects, a relationship with somebody on facebook. Ask yourself who are you helping by having emails you are never gonna do anything with in your inbox? What's the point in keeping all that crap in your attic if you're never gonna use?

By removing the stuff that makes you feel guilty you'll have the mental and physical freedom to attend to the things that truly matter to you.

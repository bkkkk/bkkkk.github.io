If you don't need to decide on it, don't even look at it. I often and regularly look at all my next actions/projects and push start dates to accommodate the reality of my current situation.

There may be interesting time-sensitive opportunities at work (new clieant), projects that get dumped on you (something broke), or resources that are not available yet (time to shop during the weekends only).

Delaying meaningfully is a tentpole of lean programming disciplines. Don't bother deciding on which database to use right now unless you have to. As the project progresses your reality might change and you won't need a database anyways.

When putting together a document, don't worry about the font, the format of the captions, or how the bilbiography entries will look. Write your document employing the systems which permit you to make these kinds of changes with minimal overhead as late as possible. For example latex allows you to make these kinds of changes with very little pain.

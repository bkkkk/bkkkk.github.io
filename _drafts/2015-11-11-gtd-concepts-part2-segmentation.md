_This is part 2 of a series looking at interesting GTD patterns that can be effectively used outside of GTD to make your life a little bit more friction free. Last time we looked at how creating inboxes can help save you time and headaches when sorting through all the things in your life._

I've been practicing David Allen's getting things done (GTD) philosophy, having achieved a good level of awareness and control over the stuff in my life. Over time some interesting patterns have emerged, which can be adapted and used in other situations. Let's have a quick look through them and how you can adopt them too.

Today we'll look at the advantages of breaking things up into smaller parcels.

### Breaking things up
<!-----Edit after here----->
The idea is simple, any given action or input into your life requires some multi-step decision process, and these steps should be done separately on their own.

When you're in capturing mode, you should only capture. When you're clarifying the meaning of items, you should only clarifying you should not be capturing new content.

Doing one kind of step at a time for multiple inputs gets your brain into the necessary mindset. I'm just going to plan my next steps for a bit, I am not gonna do anything right now. We are terrible at multitasking it turns out. And segmentation allows you to do your best at what you're engaged in.

This process is also applicable in other areas, like writing for example. For me the best way to write is to get as fast as possible to the first draft. Once the words are in place I can begin refining the writing with the entire story in place.

### What's the benefit?

Once again here the mindset is to separate the "new ideas" thinking from the "clarify what's already there" type of thinking. The two mental processes are very different and so they benefit form being separated.

In addition, by having to complete a significant part of the content creation you feel a sense of accomplishment. It's easier to continue if you feel like you're making visible progress. If you constantly switched from writing to editing to downloading pictures you'd end up spending a lot of time on not completing anything.

## The take home

Another tenant of GTD is to plan out a multistep project at the beginning. If there is something that you need to do like get a present for you mom, make sure you define the outcome ("Have a good present for mom's birthday") and then all the actions you need to make to meet that goal. (*corollary: if it's a big project define as much as you need to keep your mind at ease*)

This pattern really affects everything, just make sure to define your goals and steps as much as you can upfront, with the idea that things will likely change. It's better to have some idea of the road ahead before you step on to it. Regardless of what the top of the mountain ends up looking like.
